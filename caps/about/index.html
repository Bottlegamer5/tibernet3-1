    This website is static and <b>does not</b> use any server-side code and the website cannot provide any sort of personalised experience. A small amount of data about you is sent to Netlify which is the VPS used for this site but it is minimal and mostly information which is required for the site to work at all like your IP address. I do not get ANY data like that though, only Netlify. if you are worried for whatever reason, check with Netlify's <a href="https://docs.netlify.com">documentation</a> or <a href="https://www.netlify.com/legal/terms-of-use/">Terms of Use</a> for information. Google Fonts is also used on this site.
