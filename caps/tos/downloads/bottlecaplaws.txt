The Bottle Cap Non-Proliferation Protocol


February 2023


This paper hereby clarifies the cap-legal standard for Bottle Cap collecting from now, until the END OF TIME ITSELF.


1. Bottle Caps
From here on, the cap-legal definition of a ‘Bottle Cap’ is an object that meets the following criteria:


* Article 42: The item is intended to be disposable
* Article 43: The item was designed to be used as a bottle cap and is designed in such a way that is plausible to be used as such.
* Article 44: The item MUST be a connecting piece that connects via a knurled screw mechanism or snap-fit or other mechanical means. It must not be only a stopper as these items do not qualify as cap-legal Bottle Caps. Corks and such are STRICTLY NOT cap-legal.


Notable criteria:


*  The item may be made of any material, including metal which is commonly used for beer caps.
* The item may be of any size.
* The item may not be manufactured by the capper [Bottle Cap Collector] and it will not be cap-legal.


2. Bottle Cap Standard
From here on, cap-legal caps will be the only standard allowed in competitions of any kind tracked on websites such as https://captrack.netlify.app or similar.


Cap-Legal caps may also be referred to as Match-Caps, Kaps, Capper Caps or Good Caps.
