He had always been a bit of a loner, spending most of his days hiking and exploring the nearby forests. One day, while he was out on one of his adventures, he stumbled upon a clearing where he saw a girl sitting by a stream, sketching the scenery in front of her. She looked up and smiled at him, introducing herself as Willy.  Harbin was immediately captivated by Willy's warm smile and her passion for art. They struck up a conversation and soon found out that they shared a love for nature and the outdoors. They spent hours talking and laughing, sharing stories of their adventures and dreams.  As the sun began to set, Harbin reluctantly bid Willy farewell, promising to meet her again at the same spot the next day. He couldn't stop thinking about her all night, and the next day he eagerly made his way back to the clearing, hoping that Willy would be there waiting for him.  To his delight, she was. They spent the day together, exploring the forest, admiring the wildlife, and creating art inspired by their surroundings. As the days turned into weeks, Harbin and Willy";
