Eilam was a mischievous boy with a skeptical mind, always questioning the authenticity of what others say. He had a best friend named Freddie who was convinced that he was a hacker. Freddie would often brag about his hacking skills and how he could break into any system, but Eilam never really believed him and would often say, "A likely story" or "You clown" in response to Freddie's claims.

One day, Freddie came to school with a new set of braces. He was excited about the new addition to his smile and showed it off to everyone in his class. Eilam couldn't help but chuckle at his friend's enthusiasm. However, as the day went on, Eilam came up with a mischievous plan.

During their computing lesson, Eilam decided to play a prank on Freddie. He took out a zip-tie from his bag and waited for the right moment. As soon as the teacher turned her back, Eilam quickly slipped the zip-tie through Freddie's braces and secured it tightly. Freddie was completely unaware of what had just happened.

A few minutes later, Freddie tried to open his mouth, but he couldn't. He panicked and tried to yank his braces apart, but they wouldn't budge. Eilam couldn't hold back his laughter and burst out giggling.

Freddie turned to Eilam, his eyes wide with shock and anger. "What the hell did you just do?" he shouted.

Eilam just shrugged and replied, "Relax, it's just cable management. Your braces were all over the place, I just wanted to tidy them up a bit."

Freddie was not amused, and Eilam could tell that he was pretty angry. He quickly removed the zip-tie and apologized for his prank. Freddie forgave him, but he was still a bit annoyed with Eilam.

After that incident, Freddie was a bit more cautious around Eilam, knowing that he was always up to something. However, Eilam promised never to do anything like that again, and the two friends continued to hang out and have fun, albeit with a bit more caution. Eilam may have been mischievous, but he never meant any harm, and his friendship with Freddie was stronger than any prank he could pull.
